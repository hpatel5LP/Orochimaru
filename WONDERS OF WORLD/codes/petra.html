<div class="p2">1.1 Nabataean Civilization<br></div>
Petra was established as the capital of the Nabataeans, an Arab tribe that settled in the region around the 4th century BCE. The Nabataeans were highly skilled traders and controlled important trade routes linking Arabia, Egypt, and the Mediterranean. They amassed great wealth by taxing caravans transporting frankincense, myrrh, spices, and silk.<br>

<div class="p2">1.2 Roman Influence (106 CE - 400 CE)<br></div>
In 106 CE, the Roman Empire annexed Petra, integrating it into the province of Arabia Petraea. The Romans introduced their architectural styles, built new roads, and modified existing structures. However, the city's importance declined as trade routes shifted.<br>

<div class="p2">1.3 Byzantine and Islamic Periods (400 CE - 1100 CE)<br></div>
During the Byzantine era, Petra housed several Christian churches, and some tombs were repurposed as places of worship. After the Islamic conquest in the 7th century, Petra continued to decline, eventually becoming a forgotten city.<br>

<div class="p2">1.4 Rediscovery by Western Explorers (1812 CE)<br></div>
